# Instacart Strategic Consumer Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves a deep-dive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a modified Instacart dataset. The mission was to transform raw, "noisy" data into a clean, actionable report detailing the shopping habits of grocery delivery customers.

## Key Technical Objectives
* **Data Integrity:** Identified and resolved duplicate entries and missing values to ensure statistical accuracy.
* **Exploratory Analysis:** Analyzed 1M+ order records to uncover trends in order timing, re-order frequency, and product popularity.
* **Data Visualization:** Developed clear, stakeholder-ready visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to communicate behavioral patterns.

## The Human-Centric Insight
Beyond the code, this analysis focuses on the "why" behind the data—understanding the peak lifecycle of consumer needs and how delivery platforms can better serve human routines through data-driven logistics.

## Tools Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Matplotlib 
* Jupyter Notebooks
